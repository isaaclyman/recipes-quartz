  I often prefer chicken chili over traditional. This is a great one. I've
  received a lot of compliments for it.

* 1 red bell pepper
* 2 poblano peppers
* 4 anaheim peppers
* 2 jalapeño peppers

## Directions

In an instant pot, combine beans, chicken broth, water and bay leaves. Pressure cook for 40 - 60 minutes (the older the beans, the longer they take to cook), discard bay leaves.

Halve bell pepper, poblanos, anaheims, jalapeños, serrano peppers, and onion. Place on cookie sheet and broil until all are mostly blackened. Remove blackened skin under running water and discard. 

Dice peppers and set aside. 

Dice onions and saute with butter or ghee until translucent, set aside. 

To the beans, add chicken, drippings, coriander, cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, salt and pepper (to taste), white pepper, reserved peppers and onion.

Simmer for a while (30-60 minutes), add more chicken stock if it's too thick. 

Mix in cream, cream cheese, sour cream, and pepper jack cheese.

Add lime juice and cilantro before serving.
