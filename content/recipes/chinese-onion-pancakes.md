_Adapted from a cookbook by Pei Mei, apparently._

* 3 cups flour
* 1 cup boiling water
* 1/3 cup cold water
* 6 tablespoons shortening or lard
* 3 tablespoons chopped green onions
* 3 tsp kosher salt
* 1 cup peanut oil, plus more as needed

1. In a bowl, mix the boiling water into the flour with chopsticks. Cover and wait 3 minutes.
2. Add the cold water. Knead until elastic, then rest the dough for 15 minutes.
3. Roll the dough into a thick snake and cut into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a circle at least 6 inches in diameter.
4. Use a spoon to smear 1/2 tablespoon of shortening on the pancake. Garnish with green onions (about 1/2 tablespoon) and kosher salt (a good coating, but not too much - you'll figure it out after the first couple).
5. Roll up the pancake like a jelly roll, then curl it around itself like a snail laying on its side. Press flat and roll out into a pancake. For extra flakiness, roll it up, curl it, and press it flat again. In the end it should be about as thick as a #2 pencil or slightly thicker.
6. Fry in enough oil to cover the pancake. Turn as needed. The pancake is done when the outside is brown and crispy and the inside is flaky.
7. Cut once horizontally and 4-5 times vertically. Serve hot.
