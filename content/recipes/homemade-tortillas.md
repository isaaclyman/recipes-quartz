## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup water
* 3 tablespoons olive oil



1. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Stir in water and oil. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10-12 times, adding a little flour or water if needed to achieve a smooth dough. Let rest for 10 minutes.
2. Divide dough into 8 portions. On a lightly floured surface (using a sifter recommended as to not flour them too much), roll each portion into a 7-in. circle.
3. In a greased cast-iron or other heavy skillet, cook tortillas over medium heat until lightly browned, 1 minute on each side. Keep warm.
 _Note: if cast-iron or heavy skillet not used, the tortillas will come out slightly blackened from burnt flour, but will taste the same. Use what suits you_



_Note: Other fats work in place of olive oil. Traditionalists use lard (not kidding, I hear it's great), but shortening or coconut oil can be used as well. Just cut it into the flour before kneading._
