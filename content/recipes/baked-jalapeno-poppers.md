## Advantages over jalapeño poppers

- Easy to make
- Less mess; no deep frying required
- Doesn't ooze lava in your mouth
- Still good after a night in the fridge
- Stronger, crisper jalapeño flavor
- Adjustable spice level
- All ingredients can be substituted
- Basically impossible to mess up

## Ingredients

- Wonton or spring roll wrappers (find these in the refrigerated produce section)
- 3-4 jalapeños
- 1/2 pound bacon, cooked to your liking
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 4 oz. cream cheese, softened
- Oil or cooking spray

> [!info] Ingredient note: spring roll wrappers
> If you buy spring roll wrappers and they seem too big, cut each one into fourths. (Squares, not triangles.)

> [!info] Ingredient note: jalapeños
> You can substitute your favorite hot peppers. I've used habaneros and serranos and both have been delicious. To lower the spiciness, remove the seeds and veins from the peppers before dicing.

> [!info] Ingredient note: bacon
> You can use as much or as little bacon as you want. The recipe would even taste good without it, though you may need to add a bit of seasoning (salt, pepper, and smoked paprika, maybe?).

## Directions

1. Grease a muffin tin. Press a wonton wrapper down into each cup. The sides will ruffle and overlap a bit; that's fine. Bake at 350F for 10 minutes or until the edges brown a little.
2. Mix cream cheese, cheddar cheese, sour cream, chopped bacon, and diced peppers in a bowl. Spoon an equal amount into all the wonton cups.
3. Bake for another 8-10 minutes until the cheese is melted and the filling is gooey.
