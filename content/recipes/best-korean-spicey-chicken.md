**Pre-Sauce Ingredients** 

* Boneless chicken thighs (other types can work) – 500-600 grams
* Frying powder(chicken mix powder, 치킨가루 or 부침가루) – 1.5 cups
* COLD water – 1.5 cups
* Salt – 1 teaspoon
* Black pepper
* Minced garlic – 1/2 tablespoon
* Vinegar(any type of white wine vinegar)
* (optional) diced carrots, green onions, and sesame seeds to garnish
* (optional) cooked rice to put the fried chicken on

Note from original author: "Unfortunately, the chicken powder that I used is only available in Korea. However, you can use any chicken powder from other brands. If you want to use a Korean brand, I suggest one from ‘Beksul(백설)’."

**Sauce Ingredients**

* Korean chili paste (gochujang, 고추장) – 1 tablespoon
* Ketchup – 5 tablespoons
* Regular Soy sauce (양조간장) – 2 tablespoons
* Chili pepper flakes (gochugaru, 고춧가루) – 1 tablespoon
* Sugar – 4 tablespoons
* Minced garlic – 1 tablespoon
* Starch/Corn syrup – 4 tablespoons – If you don’t have starch/corn syrup, I recommend you to put a little more sugar to make it sweeter and stickier.

**Make the sauce**

1. Just mix the ingredients for the sauce

**Prepare the chicken**

1. Cut the chicken about 600 grams into easy-to-eat sizes and put them in a bowl. 
2. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, some black pepper and 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic to season.
3. Put 1 teaspoon of vinegar to get rid of unpleasant smell of chicken. Let’s massage it gently.
4. Microwave it for about 30 to 60 seconds. Just be careful not to cook the surface of the chicken.

**Make batter and fry**

1. Make it 1 to 1 ratio, powder and water. Start with about 1.5 cups of powder and cold water. The amount of batter depends on the amount of chicken you have. 
2. Dip the chicken into the batter. 
3. Get a big/wide container with a lid (if possible). Pour a layer of frying powder and put the chicken on top. Add some more powder if needed. Keep gaps between chicken to prevent sticking.
4. Put the lid on, and shake! When you're done, the battered chicken should be evenly coated in powder.
5. Deep fry in oil of your choice. Cook chicken center to 165°F. Should be a gentle golden brown. 
6. (optional) double fry on medium heat

**Now cook in the sauce**

1. Pour your sauce into a sauce pan, heat until it starts bubbling
2. Put your chicken into the pan and slowly mix until the chicken is evenly coated in sauce
3. (optional) Put the chicken on cooked rice. Add carrots, onions, and sesame seeds 
   to garnish.
