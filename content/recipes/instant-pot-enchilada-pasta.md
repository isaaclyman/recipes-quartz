_Adapted from_ [_sidetrackedsarah.com_](https://www.sidetrackedsarah.com/instant-pot-enchilada-pasta/)_._ This recipe can probably work in any pressure cooker. YMMV

# Ingredients

* 8 oz elbow noodles
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 cup shredded cheese
* 12 oz can enchilada sauce
* 2 cups beef broth or 15 oz can
* 2 Tbsp chili powder
* salt & pepper to taste
* ½ C. sour cream (optional, but not really optional)

# Directions

1. Brown the meat using the sauté function.
2. Drain grease (if any).  
3. Add chili powder and stir well.
4. Add the broth, pasta, and enchilada sauce to the pot. Liquid should barely cover the pasta. If not, add more broth until it does.
5. Put on lid, close valve, and cook the pasta on high for 4 minutes.
6. When done, let it release naturally for 3-4 minutes, then quick release. 
7. Open lid and stir in the cheese, salt, and pepper.
8. Add sour cream to individual servings, as desired.
