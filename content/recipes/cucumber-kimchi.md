    Napa cabbage is kinda funky. Fermented napa cabbage is even more funky. What if you don't want funky? Then eat this. No cabbage, no fermentation.

# Ingredients

- 2 English seedless cucumbers -- or any type of cucumber is fine
- 1/4 medium onion thinly sliced then sliced again in half
- 1/3 cup carrots thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp Korean red pepper flakes ("Gochugaru") Use 1 tbsp if you prefer less spicy
- 1.5 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 2 tsp fish sauce
- 1.5 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds to garnish

# Prep

1. Add cucumbers, onion, carrots, and garlic into a large bowl.  Add salt and mix to ensure the vegetables are well coated with salt.  Set aside and let sit for about 20 minutes. 
2. Drain out the excess liquid that has formed at the bottom of the bowl.
3. Add Korean red pepper flakes ("Gochugaru"), sugar, rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well then season with sesame seeds.
4. Eat by itself or serve alongside several other side dishes ("banchan") and rice.

# Notes

- Original recipe: https://olivia-yi.com/cucumber-kimchi-30-minute-recipe/
- Banchan (반찬) is the word for "side dish"
- Gochugaru (고추가루) is spicy, but not very spicy. It's kind of the spice staple of the Korean world. It has a small kick but won't set you ablaze, so don't fret about this recipe being too spicy. It balances out well.
