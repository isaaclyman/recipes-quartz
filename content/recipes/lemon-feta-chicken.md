* 2 large chicken breasts, butterflied through and flattened
* A few tablespoons of butter
* The zest of 1 lemon
* Fresh thyme leaves, 1 T. or so
* Feta cheese crumbles
* Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs
* Milk
* Coarse salt
* Toothpicks or butcher's twine

Preheat oven to 425 F.

Melt the butter and mix in the lemon zest and thyme leaves. Brush one side of each chicken breast half generously with the flavored butter. Sprinkle salt over the butter, then top with plenty of feta cheese in a patchy layer.

Roll or fold each chicken breast so the toppings are inside. Secure with toothpicks or twine. Dip in milk, then coat well with bread crumbs.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, place a wire rack in it, and put the chicken on the rack. Place a temperature probe in the thickest part of the thickest breast. Bake until the chicken registers 165 F (should take 20 to 30 minutes).

Serve hot.
