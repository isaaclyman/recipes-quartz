# Ranking

In order, the best first, are the Samyang Buldak Ramen flavors worth mentioning. 

1. Quatro Cheese - Divine condescension of food. This is S-Tier. Doesn't get better than this. Also can be divisive among people who are not cheese lovers. They're wrong in their judgement. 
    - Cheese - It's not Quatro Cheese. I put this here so you wouldn't get it on accident instead of the real stuff. 

2. Carbonara - Bit of cheese, bit of creaminess. This is nice. Probably the most widely popular flavor, and for a good reason.
    - Cream Carbonara - More creamy, less spicy, same flavor.

3. Original - This is the base flavor used in all their other flavors. So good, so versatile. Enjoy. 
    - Stew type - Basically the same, but more brothy. 

4. Jjajang - Black Bean flavor. "Bean flavor, the heck?" you may say. You underestimate the power of beans. It's warm and comforting like snuggling a large lab. 

5. Tomato - It's nice. I like it. That's about it. 

6. 2x Spicy - Save this for a challenge night with other people. It'll make your heart race and you'll get booger snakes. Normally the level of spice should equal the level of flavor. The level of spice is 2x that of flavor here. 

7. Habanero Lime - This seems to have been made for the western market. And I get it, it definitely appeals to me. Great "switch things up" flavor. Tastes exactly how it sounds. 

8. Curry - This is good. But, it's only partially committed to the curry flavor so you may be disappointed. It's like the La Croix of Curry. 

##### The literal worst
1. Corn 

##### Haven't tried
1. Kimchi - People seem to like this. My palette is not yet attuned. Will report back later. 
2. All the other obscure ones

##### Good luck finding these
1. Yakisoba - Only had this once, and I loved it. I don't know how to find it again. 
2. Light - Low calorie, less spicy.
3. 3x Spicy - Heaven have mercy upon your body.
4. Topokki - Oh what I'd give to try this.

There are many more, most discontinued and experimental, or not exported. 

# How to eat them
Three ways, in no particular order. Each delicious. 

- As instructed on the back of the package. 
- [With Creamed Tuna](https://aaronandclaire.com/korean-spicy-fire-noodles/)
    - Basically just mayo with tuna, like you're making a tuna sandwhich. Then add whatever you have: garlic or onion, salt, pepper, dark soy sauce, sririacha
    - Mix that all up, and plop it onto the prepared noodles (cooked and sauce mixed already) and then mix it in. 
    - You can top with green onions and toasted sesame seeds.
- Japanese Ramen style
    - During the last 30-60 seconds of boiling your noodles, plop in an egg or two to poach them. 
    - Retain enough water for a broth. 
    - Top with green onions, carrots, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed sheets, and any other vegetables.
