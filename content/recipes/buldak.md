# Ranking

In order, the best first, are the Samyang Buldak Ramen flavors worth mentioning. 

1. Quatro Cheese - Divine condescension of food. This is s-tier. Doesn't get better than this. Also can be divisive among people that are not cheese lovers. They're wrong in their judgement. 

2. Carbonara - Bit of cheese, bit of creaminess. This is nice. Probably the most widely popular flavor, and for a good reason. 

3. The original flavor - This is the base flavor used in all their other flavors. So good, so versatile. Enjoy. 

4. Jjajang - Black Bean flavor. "Bean flavor, the heck?" you may say. You underestimate the power of beans. It's warm and comforting like snuggling a large lab. 

5. Tomato - It's nice. That's about it. 

6. 2x Spicy - Save this for a challenge night with other people. It'll make your heart race and you'll get booger snakes. 

7. Habanero Lime - This seems to have been made for the west. And I get it, it definitely appeals to me. Great "switch things up" flavor. Tastes exactly how it sounds. 

8. Curry - This is good. But, it's only partially committed to the curry flavor so you may be a little disappointed. You can do better.

9. Cheese - It's not Quatro Cheese. I put this on the list so you wouldn't get it on accident instead of the real stuff. 

##### The literal worst
1. Corn flavor

# How to eat them
Three ways, in no particular order. Each delicious. 

- As instructed on the back of the package. 
- [With Creamed Tuna](https://aaronandclaire.com/korean-spicy-fire-noodles/)
    - Basically just mayo with tuna, like you're making a tuna sandwhich. Then add whatever you have: garlic or onion, salt, pepper, dark soy sauce, sririacha
    - Mix that all up, and plop it onto the prepared noodles (cooked and sauce mixed already) and then mix it in. 
    - You can top with green onions and toasted sesame seeds.
- Japanese Ramen style
    - During the last 30-60 seconds of boiling your noodles, plop in an egg or two to poach them. 
    - Retain a bit more water so there's a broth. 
    - Top with green onions, carrots, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed sheets, and any other vegetables.
