## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Â¼ cup small onion diced
* 1 jalapeno seeded and minced (just a green bell pepper works too)
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 cups long-grain rice
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon oregano
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 2/3 cup tomato sauce
* 1 tablespoon butter (optional (no it isn't))

## Directions

1. Place rice in a colander and rinse well.
2. Turn Instant Pot to saute and let it heat up.
3. Add in oil, onion, jalapeno, and garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes.
4. Turn Instant Pot OFF.
5. Add in broth and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the inner pot.
6. Add in seasonings and stir well. 
7. Add in rice and gently push down with a spoon to submerge in broth. 
8. Top with tomato sauce (don't stir).
9. Place lid on the Instant Pot and be sure vent knob is set to sealed.
10. Cook on HIGH pressure for 3 (we did 6 and that works too if you're worried about under-cooking) minutes for long-grain white rice, and 22 minutes for long-grain brown rice.
11. Let pressure release naturally all the way (leave it sealed until pressure button pops up).
12. Remove lid and fluff rice with a fork, while stirring in the tomato sauce you added earlier.
13. Stir in butter if desired and serve.
