---
* 2 cups milk chocolate chips*
* 8 oz cream cheese, softened\*\*
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped
* Graham cracker crust (see note)

<sup>* I made this with semisweet chocolate chips one time and it was pretty effin' dark. I only recommend doing that if you're going to your first meeting of the Society of Dark Chocolate Necromancers and you've got something to prove. I took it to a group date and didn't impress anyone.</sup>

<sup>\*\* If you don't soften your cream cheese fully, you'll end up with cheese blobs throughout your pie. Still delicious but a little embarrassing.</sup>

1. Microwave the chocolate chips for 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval until smooth.
2. Beat cream cheese, chocolate, and vanilla in a mixer until light in color. Fold in whipped cream.
3. Spoon the mixture into the graham cracker crust. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until firm.

## Note

A graham cracker crust consists of several graham crackers ground to powder in a blender and combined with enough melted butter to give them the texture of moist sand, but not so much as to make them uniformly dark or doughy. Some people add granulated sugar, but I find that makes the crust gritty. Press out the mixture into a pie pan, all the way up the sides.
