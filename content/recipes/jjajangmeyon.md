# Ingredients

*    1.5 large yellow onions
*    2 green cabbage leaves
*    1 bunch green onions, about 3.5 oz (100g)
*    1/2 tsp (2g) grated ginger
*    3 tbsp neutral-tasting oil (such as grape seed, canola, vegetable oil, etc.)
*    7 oz (200g) ground pork
*    3 tbsp black bean paste (chunjang, 춘장)
*    1/2 tbsp soy sauce
*    1.5 tbsp sugar
*    1 tbsp oyster sauce
*    1 tbsp chicken bouillon powder
*    1/4 cup (60ml) water
*    Small pinch of MSG ("optional")
*    2 servings jungwha myeon (중화면) (or kalguksu, udon noodles, etc.. If you can't find those, just use any noodles you have)

###### Cornstarch Slurry:

*    1/2 tbsp cornstarch
*    1 tbsp water

###### Options for Topping:

*    1/2 cucumber
*    2 fried eggs
*    Green onions

# Instructions

#### Prep vegetables

1. Cut the onions into nice, big chunks. Cut the cabbage into bite-sized pieces. Thinly slice the green onions. Cut the cucumber into matchsticks.

2. Grate a small knob of ginger. About 1/2 teaspoon would be perfect.
MAKE SAUCE & COOK NOODLES

1. In a wok (or pan), heat the oil (3 tbsp) over high heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the ground pork. Break up the pork and saute for 1 to 2 minutes or until no longer pink. 

2. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the ginger along with 3 tablespoons of black bean paste. Stir it constantly for 1 to 2 minutes. Be careful not to burn it!

3. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the green onions, onion, and cabbage. Stir-fry for 2 minutes or until the vegetables are starting to soften.

4. Add the soy sauce, sugar, oyster sauce, chicken bouillon powder, water, and MSG (if using). Stir around for 3 minutes.

5. Make a quick cornstarch slurry and add it to the sauce. Stir it all together until it’s thickened.

6. (While working on step 4) Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Rinse the noodles under cold water and drain.

###### Assemble

1. Divide the noodles into serving bowls. Add half of the sauce to each bowl. You can also throw the noodles into the pan and mix them up there. 

2. Top with cucumber, fried egg, green onions, whatever sounds good. The original recipe suggests to serve it with yellow pickled radish or kimchi. Enjoy!
