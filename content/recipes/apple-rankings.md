The above apples were ranked subjectively and unscientifically by one person over the course of several weeks.

_Pink Lady_ and _Jazz_ apples are hard rather than crispy, so their crunch values should be considered accordingly.

_Pink Lady_ apples are tart rather than sweet, so their flavor value should be considered accordingly.

_Fuji_ apples are far juicier than any other apple tested.
