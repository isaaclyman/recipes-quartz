**Corned beef:**

* 3 pounds corned beef with packet (corned beef round is my favorite, but any cut will do)
* 1 cup water
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 T sugar
* 2 T apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

1. Add corned beef, fat side up, to a slow cooker. Top with minced garlic, spice packet, sugar and pepper and rub in. Add the cider vinegar and bay leaf around the bottom of the slow cooker and add just enough water to come up about 25% to the top of the meat.
2. Cook on low for 9-10 hours.

**Russian dressing:**

* 1-2 cups thousand island dressing, or a mixture of mayonnaise and homemade chili sauce
* 1 teaspoon hot sauce, like Frank's Red Hot
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* Sea salt to taste

1. Mix all ingredients, adding more hot sauce, Worcestershire, paprika and salt to taste.

**Sandwich:**

* Light rye bread (often sold as New York Rye)
* Sauerkraut
* Swiss cheese, sliced

1. Rest the corned beef for 10 minutes at room temperature, then slice thinly against the grain.
2. Toast two slices of rye bread.
3. Layer the following from bottom to top: bread, Russian dressing, corned beef, sauerkraut, swiss cheese. Place under a broiler until the cheese is fully melted, then top with the other slice of bread.
4. Cut diagonally ([triangles taste better](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/11/triangles-taste-better-charity-t-shirt-sale-la-cocina.html)) and serve.
