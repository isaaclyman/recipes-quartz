**Sauce:**

* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 T fresh ginger, chopped fine, or 1/2 T ground ginger
* A few drops of sesame oil
* 2 T rice vinegar
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 T sriracha
* 2 T sugar
* 1 T cornstarch, dissolved in 1/4 cup chicken broth
* 1-2 T mirin

Combine, stir well, and set aside.

**Veg:** Use any combination of the following.

* Broccoli florets
* Bell pepper, sliced
* White onion, sliced
* Green onions, diced
* Pineapple chunks
* Sugar snap peas
* Carrots, sliced thin diagonally

Heat a couple tablespoons of neutral oil in a wok or skillet on medium-high heat until shimmering. Add a layer of vegetables, no more than a couple of inches thick, and stir vigilantly until vegetables are tender but still crispy. (If you add too many vegetables at once, they'll steam in their own moisture instead of frying.) Move the cooked vegetables to a large bowl or plate, add more oil to the pan, and repeat as needed with the remaining vegetables. Once the vegetables are all cooked, return them to the pan and pour the sauce over them. Cook for a minute or two until the sauce thickens and coats the vegetables.

Serve immediately with rice or chow mein noodles.
