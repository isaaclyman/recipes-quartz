# Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 lb Italian sausage 
* 1 shallot
* White balsamic vinegar (or regular, if you don't have it)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 6oz can of tomato paste
* 1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp oregano
* 2 tsp basil
* 1 Tbsp and 2 tsp parsley, divided
* 1 bay leaf
* A couple teaspoons of chicken bouillon (2 cubes, or a spoonful of "Better than Bouillon")
* 1 box lasagna noodles
* 1 32oz container of Ricotta
* 1 egg
* 1-2 lbs grated Mozzarella cheese
* 2 C grated Asiago or Parmesan cheese

# Directions

Saute the ground beef and Italian sausage until super well-browned, you want that crusty, almost crunchy dark brown crust. 

Set meat aside and get a pot of water going on a burner for the pasta.

Saute a minced shallot in the leftover grease.

Add meat back in and saute with several tablespoons of white balsamic vinegar and some salt and pepper to taste.

After about a minute, mix in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, garlic powder, oregano, basil, parsley, bay leaf, and chicken bouillon.

If needed, add up to a cup of water to thin it out, aim for a Ragu/Prego viscosity.

Turn to low and cover.

Water should be boiling now, so cook the noodles.

In a large bowl, mix ricotta, egg, 1 T parsley, salt to taste, and a few handfuls of grated mozzarella cheese.

# Assembly 

Put some sauce in the bottom of a large casserole dish, then layer noodles, ricotta mixture, meat sauce, and grated mozzarella cheese.

Optional: alternate grated mozzarella cheese with slices of provolone cheese.

Do a final layer of noodles, a small amount of meat sauce, and a generous layer of cheese. 

Bake for 45 minutes at 350ยบ F, then remove and add shredded asiago or parmesan cheese to the top, then broil until bubbly and golden.
