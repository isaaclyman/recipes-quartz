All measurements are estimates. Use your best judgment.

* 3 cups [creamed spinach](https://recipes.isaaclyman.com/post/creamed-spinach/)
* 3-6 eggs
* 3/4 cup julienned smoked ham
* 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
* 1 cup panko bread crumbs
* Chives to garnish (optional)

1. Preheat the oven to 350.
2. Spread the creamed spinach evenly in a cast iron skillet. Make some large divots around the circumference of the spinach, 1-2 inches away from the edge of the pan and each other. Break an egg into each divot.
3. Put the skillet in the oven and bake until the egg whites are solid.
4. Top with the ham, cheese, panko, and a little more cheese, then broil until the panko is well toasted and the top cheese is brown.
5. Garnish with chives and serve immediately.
