* 1 jalapeno, rolled between the palms and halved longways
* 2 medium tomatoes, halved
* 1/4 large onion, roughly diced
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 1 T olive oil
* Italian seasoning to taste
* Kosher salt to taste
* MSG to taste
* A dash of rosemary
* 2 small cans tomato sauce
* A splash (1/4 c. or so) of chicken broth
* A pat of cream cheese (maybe 2 T)
* 1-2 chicken breasts or thighs, trimmed and cut into bite-sized chunks

1. In a cast iron skillet, scorch the jalapenos and tomatoes on medium-high heat until the skin blackens (but not the flesh), turning and moving them as needed to maximize roastage. Remove and dice them both, discarding the burnt skin.
2. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the olive oil to the pan, then return the diced jalapenos and tomatoes. Crush the italian seasoning between your hands and add to the pan. Add the kosher salt, MSG, and rosemary. Heat for 12 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Meanwhile, saute the chicken with oil in another pan until browned.
4. Add the tomato sauce, chicken broth, cream cheese, and chicken to the tomato mixture. Stir to combine. Turn the heat down to low until ready to serve.
5. Serve over rice (Indian style) or with black beans, cheese, and sour cream (Mexican style).
