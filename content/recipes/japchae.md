## **Ingredients**

I've found that even the pickiest eaters love this, my kids included. Looks are deceiving, it's way tastier than it looks.

Double the recipe for small groups or family. 

# Ingredients

* 8.8 oz (250g) pork loin (or beef, chicken) (Use lean parts)
* 1/2 yellow onion
* 50g carrot
* 50g red/yellow bell peppers
* 50g shiitake mushrooms (zucchini is a good substitute)
* 50g garlic chives (if you can't get any, do green onions instead and add them as a garnish at the end)
* 120g Dangmyeon ("dong-myun") noodles (AKA Korean sweet potato starch noodles, glass noodles, Japchae noodles, 당면)
* 1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce ("optional")
* 1.5 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 2 tbsp neutral-tasting oil
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 tbsp minced garlic
* Generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds

###### Sauce:

* 1.5 tbsp sugar
* 1.5 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1/2 tsp MSG ("optional")

# Instructions

#### Cook noodles

1. In a wok (or pot), add Dangmyeon noodles with 6 cups of water. Add 1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce (if using). Bring it to a boil over medium heat.

2. Once it starts to boil, set a timer for 6 minutes. Stir it occasionally. Drain the noodles and put them in a bowl. Coat them with the sesame oil (1.5 tbsp). Set aside.

#### Make sauce

In a small container, mix together the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and MSG.

#### Stir-fry all the things

1. In a wok (or pan), heat the oil (2 tbsp) over medium heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the pork and season with salt and pepper.

2. Once the pork is no longer pink, add the garlic (1 tbsp), onion, carrot, and bell peppers. Stir-fry everything. 

3. Once the vegetables are slightly cooked, add the shiitake mushrooms (or zucchini) and garlic chives. Add the sauce.

4. Reduce the heat to low. Add the noodles and stir to combine.

5. Transfer it to a serving plate. Sprinkle on a good amount of toasted sesame seeds (the white non-toasted ones are fine too). 

6. Yum
