_This recipe can safely be played with. Change the quantity of any ingredient, use whatever you've got on hand, change the method of preparation. It's hard to screw up._

* 1 tomatillo (try to find one with sticky skin underneath the leaf)
* 2 jalapenos (feel free to mix and match with serranos and habaneros)
* 1-2 tomatoes
* 1/4 large onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 handful cilantro leaves - optional
* 1 T hot sauce - optional (I recommend Yellowbird Habanero Condiment)
* 2 assorted dried chiles - optional (guajillo, chile de arbol, chipotle, whatever tastes good to you)
* Lime juice and salt to taste

1. Heat a cast-iron skillet or comal over high heat until very hot. Place the tomatillo, jalapenos, and tomatoes in the skillet, whole, uncut, and without any water or oil. Turn them occasionally with tongs as they cook. The tomato and tomatillo should soften and develop burnt spots all over the skin (but be careful not to burn the flesh); the jalapenos should singe white or black on all sides, again without burning the flesh.*
2. Remove everything from the skillet and let cool for a minute. Use tongs to peel the skin off the tomato and remove burnt patches from the tomatillo and jalapenos.
3. Put the tomatillo, jalapenos, onion, and garlic in a blender and blend until smooth.
4. Add the hot sauce, dried chiles, cilantro, and lime juice. Blend well. Add salt and blend one more time.
5. Serve at any temperature.

<sup>\*A common alternative is to boil the tomatillo, jalapenos and tomatoes in a pot of water for several minutes instead of singeing them. This produces a "bright" flavor as opposed to a "roasty" flavor.</sup>

_Note:_ Add a squirt of chile to equal parts ketchup and mayo for an amazing dipping sauce.
