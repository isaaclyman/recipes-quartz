## Recommended tools

- An empty gallon jug for each recipe of concentrate
- Large funnel that fits the mouth of a gallon jug
- 5-gallon or larger beverage dispenser
- A long ladle or spoon for stirring the horchata in the dispenser
- Three-quart or larger pitcher
- Large mesh strainer that fits over the top of the pitcher
- High-quality blender, like a Blendtec or Vitamix

## Calculating ingredients

**Each gallon** of concentrate will make **four to five gallons** of prepared horchata.

If multiple drink options are available, five gallons of horchata is enough for 200+ guests.

### For each gallon of concentrate

- 7.5 C. white rice
- 7.5 cinnamon sticks
- 2.5 T. vanilla extract
- Hot water from the tap

> [!info] Ingredient note
> Cinnamon sticks come in four varieties. They differ in strength, flavor, and size. This will be the main flavor component of the finished product, so make sure to do a [test batch](#test-batch) and adjust as needed.

### For each 4-5 gallons of prepared horchata

- 1 recipe of concentrate
- 11.5 C. whole milk
- 7.5 C. granulated sugar
- 30 C. (just under two gallons) cold water
- Ice

## Preparation

### Day One

Into each gallon jug, add white rice and cinnamon sticks from 1 concentrate recipe. Fill the jug the rest of the way with hot tap water.

Let soak overnight in the refrigerator.

### Day Two

Thoroughly blend each recipe of concentrate, then strain back into the gallon jug. Add vanilla extract. Put back in the refrigerator.

> [!info] Technique
>
> - You'll need to blend in multiple batches per recipe unless your blender is gigantic.
> - The number of cinnamon sticks in each batch will determine how thick it is.
> - Upend the jug of concentrate over the blender cup and shake gently until the cup is full. Then use the funnel to pour liquid back into the jug until the liquid in the blender cup only covers the rice by an inch or so.
> - Don't overfill the blender lest it explode all over your kitchen.
> - Blend for 15 seconds on medium-low speed, then increase to medium-high until only very fine specks of cinnamon are visible, about 30 seconds.
> - Your blender will overheat if you're making multiple gallons of concentrate. Plan time to let it cool for an hour after each two recipes or whenever it gets too hot.
> - After blending, pour the mixture through a mesh strainer or sieve into a large pitcher. When the strainer gets clogged, stir and spread the contents with a spoon until they reach the consistency of toothpaste, then discard the solids and rinse the strainer before using again.
> - When the jug is empty, rinse out any remaining grains of rice, then use the funnel to pour the blended concentrate back in.

### Day Three (day of event)

The concentrate will separate and settle significantly. Shake very well before using.

For each 5-gallon refill, add 1 jug of concentrate, then whole milk, sugar, and cold water. Add ice (about one gallon) to fill.

Stir frequently from the bottom to prevent settling. Ideally, serve with a ladle. A spigot is more likely to clog or dispense unevenly thick horchata.

## Test batch

To make about a half gallon of horchata, add the following to a container:

- 1 C. white rice
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 C. hot water

Cover and soak overnight, then blend well and strain. Finally, add:

- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1.5 C. whole milk
- 1 C. granulated sugar
- 4 C. cold water

Chill until ready to serve. Add ice as desired.

## Recipe notes

Most horchata recipes call for a can of evaporated milk and a can of sweetened condensed milk per half gallon, rather than whole milk and sugar. This will make a very creamy and delicious horchata, but it's prohibitively expensive for large quantities. This recipe is a crowd-pleaser on a much smaller budget.

Horchata makers often recommend straining the horchata concentrate through a cheesecloth. This results in the smoothest possible horchata. The mesh strainer is much faster, though, and many people like a bit of graininess to their horchata anyway.
