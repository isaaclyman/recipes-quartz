*Note:* I originally got this recipe from my brother, who called it "Italian Chicken." It's hard to say where the name came from; there's nothing Italian about it. You could argue Asian influence, since soy sauce is the star flavor, but it's a quesadilla? So I'm going with Unitalian Chicken.

## Ingredients

**Chicken and sauce**

- 1 to 2 lbs raw, boneless chicken, cubed
- 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce (see note)
- 1/2 cup regular soy sauce
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1/4 cup neutral oil, like canola (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

**Thickener**

- 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 Tablespoons water

**Quesadillas**

- 4-6 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded
- Flour tortillas

> **Chicken:** If you forgot to defrost your chicken, you can pop it in the microwave just long enough to melt the outermost layer of ice, then cube it and sear it in a few tablespoons of oil until it's no longer pink.
> 
> **Soy sauce:** You can use 1 full cup of regular soy sauce (Kikkoman or whatever) and skip the low-sodium, but it will turn out very salty. I love salt, but even I have my limits. I strongly recommend using low-sodium for at least half the soy sauce, then regular soy sauce for the remainder. If you have other types of soy sauce on hand, e.g. dark or tamari, add a splash of those as well—the flavor will only benefit.
> 
> **Red pepper:** If your kids are sensitive to spice, you can skip the red pepper. Feel free to reduce the black pepper as well.

## Directions

1. Add the soy sauce(s), vinegar, oil, red pepper, black pepper, and garlic powder to a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir to combine, then add the chicken. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through (165 F, or about 10 minutes).
2. Mix the cornstarch and water together until dissolved. Add to the chicken mixture and stir until it thickens up, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat.
3. In another skillet, over medium heat, assemble the quesadillas: place down a tortilla, add some cheese, add a sparse layer of the chicken mixture, top with a little more cheese, and fold the tortilla in half to close. Cook until the tortilla starts to brown on the bottom, flip it over, and cook until browned on the other side.
4. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, cheese, and chicken mixture.
5. If desired, scoop the excess sauce into a bowl for dipping. Cut each quesadilla into slices, pizza-style, and serve.
