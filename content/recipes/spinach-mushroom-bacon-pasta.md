* 8 oz bacon
* Half a large onion, diced
* A couple of assorted dried mild chiles, diced
* Dried parsley, basil, ground pepper, kosher salt, and MSG to taste
* 4 oz mushrooms
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Cream, an extended splash (maybe 1/4 cup?)
* Spinach, a couple handfuls
* 8 oz pepper jack cheese, shredded
* 8 oz macaroni or other pasta, cooked according to package directions



1. Cook the bacon to the desired crispiness in a large skillet. Then set it aside on a plate, leaving the grease in the pan.
2. Cook the onion and dried chiles in the bacon grease over medium-high heat. After a minute, add all the seasonings. When fragrant, add the mushrooms and garlic and turn the heat down to medium. Cook until everything is warmed through.
3. Turn the heat to low, wait a minute for the pan to cool, and add the cream, enough to make the mixture saucy. Add the spinach and cover, stirring occasionally, until the spinach has cooked down.
4. Add the cheese and mix. Add the pasta and mix again. Serve hot.
