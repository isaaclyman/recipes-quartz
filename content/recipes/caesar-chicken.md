## Ingredients

- 6-8 boneless skinless chicken breasts 
- 1/2 cup Ken's creamy Caesar dressing 
- 1/2 cup Ken's Italian dressing 
- 1 cup shredded or grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup garlic crouton crumbs 
- 1 diced onion 

## Directions

1. Melt butter in a casserole dish. Add the onion and some crouton crumbs. 
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
3. Crush croutons into coarse crumbs. 
4. In a shallow bowl combine the Caesar and Italian dressings. Set aside. 
5. In another shallow bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese and crouton crumbs.
6. Take each chicken breast, dredge in the dressing mixture, and roll in the crumb mixture. Place in the casserole dish, top with remaining croutons (plus a few whole croutons around the edges of the pan) and bake for 30-40 minutes or until juices run clear and chicken is done.
